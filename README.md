# Music Management System ðŸŽµ

This project is a comprehensive Music Management System built with Go (Golang) and PostgreSQL. It provides functionalities to manage albums, artists, songs, and playlists efficiently. The application leverages the `database/sql` package in Go to interact seamlessly with a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- **Albums Management**: Create, read, update, and delete albums with attributes like name, tracks, and artist.
- **Artists Management**: Add and manage artists seamlessly.
- **Songs Management**: Handle songs with details like song ID, name, artist, and album.
- **Playlists Management**: Create playlists, add songs to playlists, and manage them effectively.
- **User Interaction**: User-friendly command-line interface for adding and managing songs in playlists.

## Project Structure

- `main.go`: The main entry point of the application, handling database connections and user interactions.
- `models.go`: Contains the definitions of the Album, Artist, Songs, and Playlist structs.
- `db.go`: Includes functions to interact with the PostgreSQL database for various CRUD operations.
